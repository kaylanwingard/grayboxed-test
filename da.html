            <b>NOTE:</b> please remember the dark army is a criminal organization centered around a delusional belief of whiterose's. she believes that the machine she is building in washington township can be used to jump universes, specifically into one that is happier and more suited to whoever needs it. people believe in this so deeply that they kill themselves rather than be captured in order to further the mission. it is, in its brainwashing techniques and how insular it is, functionally a cult.</div>

                <ul>
                    <li>in this series, both sam and elliot are around simultaneously. elliot is a member of the dark army who spends his weekends working on the washington township plant machine. in this way, he&#39;s living two lives. </li>
                    <li>they split in the server room incident, and sam adds a third life that elliot&#39;s living without knowing it. sam establishes a general talking relationship with krista.</li>
                    <li>elliot&#39;s working at allsafe because it&#39;s close to e corp. both elliot and angela travel to washington township on the weekends to work on the machine.</li>
                    <li>rather than 5/9, sam is focused on stopping the dark army. he begins going to coney island on nights and off weekends. elliot doesn&#39;t know this is happening, and doesn&#39;t know sam&#39;s formed fsociety with darlene and a few others. </li>
                    <li>elliot doesn&#39;t know sam exists until the vera situation, where sam takes over to try to save shayla&#39;s life. sam manages to keep it together until darlene meets him at the boardwalkâ€”it&#39;s elliot who shows up, and who, baffled and terrified, goes to washington township to figure out what&#39;s going on. for the first time, sam and elliot meet.</li>
                    <li>sam pulls off his plan to encrypt a bunch of e corp data and, by sabotaging the plant, sideline whiterose&#39;s plan. he then sends them to jail by self-reporting on flipper so elliot can&#39;t work on reversing it, and so he and elliot can have it out.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>if you want to meet sam, you'll need to be hanging around coney island at night most of the time.</li>
                        <li>elliot is nicer than sam. but he's also, you know, sort of busy with ignoring this world. hard to care about people when you can just do it all right in the next world.</li>
                        <li>fsociety is very small in this verse and will remain that way.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>jail goes as badly as it always does. sam is worse and better than mr. robot in jail in different ways. elliot is receiving dark army ciphers and directions in jail, sam&#39;s fighting him over it, and mr. robot, the most tired man alive, is just keeping it together. <ul>
                    <li>without dark army direction, elliot basically turns into a beige carpet of a man. he doesn&#39;t know what else to be! he&#39;s been in this since he was basically twenty or so.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>on the outside, darlene&#39;s arc is mostly similar. angela&#39;s role is a lot more fraught, and under the additional pressure of the new e corp job, she starts to crack. </li>
                    <li>sam and elliot finally come to a resolution in jail. or they do for a little while, anyway, until the end of the season. </li>
                    <li>during the final conversation with tyrell, sam takes over and, because of his interference, tyrell shoots him. he barely survives. angela is assigned as his and tyrell&#39;s handler.</li>
                    <li>once they do get out, sam finally agrees to help elliot because they have to stay valuable to the dark army to survive. now they&#39;re valuable beyond belief. they&#39;re an expert hacker. they can be on the &quot;recovery team&quot; so to speak for the dark army&#39;s data, like angela suggested, and sam agrees to this because it puts him closer to the dark army.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>look, elliot's in jail for this one. it has all the usual problems of s2 communication.</li>
                        <li>fsociety still isn't as public in this one because their focus was different, but it definitely gets picked up by anti-corporate groups.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>this is the part of the story where everyone&#39;s at odds. sam has his mission, elliot wants to help whiterose, mr. robot is trying to just hold everything together and has to support both of them when necessary. </li>
                    <li>whiterose&#39;s plan is to use tyrell as an eventual scapegoat for all the fsociety stuff. this allows darlene to become an informant because she&#39;ll point them towards tyrell rather than her own brother. dom dipierro is the only one immune to the propaganda. </li>
                    <li>the pressure keeps escalating. everyone&#39;s living multiple lives. elliot isn&#39;t told about the 71 buildings because of his instability, and when it happens, it&#39;s what fully starts to crack his loyalty to whiterose&#39;s vision. angela, on the other hand, buys in three times as deeply, as we see in canon.</li>
                    <li>whiterose initially intends to kill elliot and darlene at the barn to clean up some messy loose ends, but he proves he can, well, outthink the entire dark army. killing darlene leaves elliot with nothing left, and is a bad move. so the aldersons are left alive. </li>
                    <li>the dark army basically abandons elliot here and is just stringing him along to make sure the congo shipping hack goes through. angela is killed because of her inability to let go, and whiterose&#39;s bet is that this will break elliot down enough that he&#39;ll be nearly useless anyway.</li>
                    <li>technically, this works. for about a week.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>this is a much easier time to meet either elliot or sam, but with both of them at odds. so it's a kind of difficult time, because they're flighty, unreliable, and basically fighting it out.</li>
                        <li>fsociety is still framed for the 71 buildings, so do with that what you will.</li>

                <h1>SERIES 4</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>elliot recedes here, because the grief and trauma are eating him alive. sam is the one who&#39;s on the revenge tour, who&#39;s angry and driven and needs to save them and darlene.</li>
                    <li>season 4 mainly unfolds as written. tyrell&#39;s death is actually especially useful, because it helps elliot lock in and do something rather than just standing there. if one of the most pathetic guys you know, with the demeaor of a soaking wet cat, makes a choice, what the fuck are you doing with your life?</li>
                    <li>unfortunately, this also leads to everything with olivia. elliot drugging her is such a deeply dark army coded thing to do, as in canon, it&#39;s what basically shows where he&#39;s at in terms of moral compromise. sam even letting it happen shows how far they&#39;ve gone. </li>
                    <li>the middle part of the season unfolds as written. sorry but 4x07 and 4x08 are necessary, and 4x09 basically unfolds as written. whiterose is even more directly angry about it. that was the guy she basically hired and he turned around, stole all her money, and ruined her prospects of finishing the machine. the white and black chess metaphor really did win. whiterose would be able to notice something in elliot changed, but would not know what.</li>
                    <li>so, the finale changes a bit. the events remain the same, but the reasoning is different. the loop&#39;s far later: hastily built in 4x07 to shelter elliot, to take time when he&#39;s in agony to make elliot a safe place. truly, it&#39;s about love to the point of invention.</li>
                    <li>right now, sam&#39;s better at existing than elliot is. elliot doesn&#39;t know who or what he is without this singular driving purpose, this idea of a better world. the messaging is not &#39;i&#39;m real, you&#39;re not real&#39;. instead it&#39;s &#39;i, sam, who held it all together, deserve this and you, a guy who i think is not elliot but i am projecting my own conflict with elliot onto, don&#39;t deserve this&#39; (it is actually elliot).</li>
                    <li>it&#39;s that question of deserving it. who deserves justice, who deserves the better world, who deserves revenge?</li>
                    <li>sam lets go because elliot deserves a chance to heal and grow. they need that. it&#39;s not even a question of deserving. and it&#39;s also that darlene needs them. and darlene deserves to have a brother who&#39;s really there, not constantly crushed by himself or an obsession with an impossible dream.</li>
                    <li>if the dark army belief is about escape, then you have to choose to stay. and you have to choose to go. it&#39;s still the same story.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>this is the system at their most unstable. elliot swings in and out of being present or not, and sam is at his angriest and most unwell.</li>
                        <li>interactions during this time are as distant as s1, but for very different reasons. hopping in here is bad, but coming in earlier and meeting the system again during this time is more viable.</li>

                <h1>POST-CANON</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>look, i&#39;m going to be real. elliot broke about 4 ribs and also is very unwell. he needs to spend several months in an institution to basically figure out how to function at all. it&#39;s a long, winding recoveryâ€”even longer than in canon. he has a lot of apologies to make, and a lot of ugly things to unpack. </li>
                    <li>there&#39;s morphine relapses at least once. but he does have more of a support system.  </li>
                    <li>he has a really hard time breaking a lot of the dark army-based compulsions. he switches out phones, his security is absurd, he splits his trips places between two subway switches or whatever, and he is always looking over his shoulder. it&#39;ll take years to break that. </li>
                    <li>everything with angela is somehow worse because he blames himself for angela and putting her in contact with the dark army. maybe whiterose chose to kill angela, but elliot&#39;s the one who gave whiterose the gun.</li>
                    <li>this can spiral in lots of ways. traveling with leon is good because it recontextualizes traveling so often to washington township and instead makes traveling a positive. staying in place is good because it&#39;s so different from what was happening before and it forces him to Stay In Place. like canon, there&#39;s a lot of flexibility in where it ends up.</li>

                        <li>are you ex-dark army? buddy, this guy's about to show up and do reparations with you.</li>
                        <li>this has the biggest variety of possible interactions overall. elliot can be anywhere, and i will put him at least a year or more out of canon events for his own sake.</li>
                        <li>elliot in this is much more willing to be violent (he's used to seeing it) but it's also very bad for him mentally. he's more likely to defend himself and be firmer, but a lot of that is an act. people who can break through that act can find a person who is still trying to figure out what being a person even means.</li>
