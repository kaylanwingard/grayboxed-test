            <div class="warn-desc"><p>hey. as a note, this is the <b>only</b> closed verse on this blog for a reason. elliot's canon in general is tonally dark and full of difficult content. this verse is that but accelerated. please understand this: <b>the dark army functions similarly to a cult</b>. it is first and foremost a criminal organization, but its recruitment methods are coercive and involve manipulation, and the only exit is death, often by suicide.</p>
            
            <p>the dark army recruits vulnerable people who are looking for purpose in their life. the truth about elliot alderson is that he, if he were caught at the right time in his life, would be susceptible to this. in canon, he turns away from this offer when it's made because he understands the context of the dark army and what it does to people. in a world where he doesn't have that context and he's given the offer, he isn't nearly as likely to turn away.</p>
        
            <p><b>writing in this verse requires thoughtfulness and in-depth plotting.</b> this is not an 'evil' verse or anything like that. it follows the general broad narrative arc of canon, but the entire system is involved, and dynamics change intensely. it's volatile and needs to be handled with care.</p>
