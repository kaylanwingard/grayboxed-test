              i’m k, my pronouns are she/they, i’m 25, my time zone’s pst, and
              there’s a lot to say here, so let’s get into it.
            </div>
          <p>
            <span>CONTENT WARNING</span> this blog will have a lot of triggering
            content, including but not limited to: mental illness (specifically
            dissociative identity disorder, depression, and anxiety), violence,
            drug usage, trauma, and current events. i tag for all of this as
            trigger tw, which translates as mental illness tw, drugs tw, etc.
            because of this, i <b>will not write with minors</b>.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span>ACTIVITY</span> this is a low activity blog. i will be on and
            off here as my brain works, and if i’m not here, you might find me at
            <b>@debtbound</b>.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span>SHIPPING</span> i can ship, but i’m very careful about who i do
            and don’t ship with. elliot is, again, a lot for himself and even more
            of a handful for other people, so anything we do will have to be
            plotted out.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span>WRITING & STYLE</span> i don't use icons and i use normal sized
            text. i don't mind if other people use small text. double small text
            can be hard for me to read sometimes. also, although i generally write
            in third person, i like first person threads. you'll never meet a guy
            more befitting of first person threads than elliot alderson.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span>ON CANON</span> i basically follow the canon of the show.
            there’s very little that i change besides some notes that you can see
            in the <b>portrayal section</b> on this page.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span>INTERACTIONS</span> elliot by his nature basically demands
            plotting before interacting. ask memes can also be very helpful for
            me, since it lets me mess around in his head about a person before
            getting into something. i may occasionally put out starter calls, but
            they won’t be as frequent on this blog as other blogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>NEED A SUMMARY?</span> i genuinely recommend reading the wiki
            summaries of the show. if you want to chat about anything or have
            questions, let me know!

         <p>
            <span>001</span> elliot is not a particularly nice person.
            he’s trying to do good, but he is hampered by paranoia and severe
            mental illness. even in post-canon, when it's more controlled, it is a
            long and difficult uphill battle. he will lie to your muse. he will
            dissociate and talk to the reader just to get the hell out of there. he is often compelled to hack just
            about everyone he meets. he does not trust easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>002</span> please be respectful about mental illness on here.
            there is no such thing as a 'bad' alter. every alter has their purpose
            and a reason that they needed to exist, regardless of how kind or
            agreeable they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>003</span> i interpret elliot as a trans man. terfs and
            transphobes can fuck off. he uses <b>he/him</b> pronouns generally.
            this means that pronouns can sometimes be a little unclear on this
            blog. please note that "they" is often used to refer to the system as
            a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>004</span> i diverge from canon on a few things, more to fit my
            portrayal than any actual issues with canon. something important to
            note is that each of his parents had pre-existing marriages. elliot
            was his mother's biological child, and when they were married, he was
            around two or three years old and darlene had just been born to his
            father's prior marriage. this technically makes them adoptive
            siblings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>005</span> plotting during the canon of mr. robot can be
            incredibly difficult. all 45 episodes of its show happen across,
            basically, march 2015 to december 2015. elliot is basically not
            available for significant portions of time during that. it's easiest
            to plot with them post-canon, and some things might be placed
            pre-canon.
