                <h2>SO, WHAT'S THE WORLD LOOK LIKE?</h2>
                <p>imagine a world like ours, but a few seconds closer to midnight. the world of <i>mr. robot</i>
                is barely outside of the one we live in. it's a little grimier, a little angrier, and a lot
                more prone to revolution, but mostly, it's just like ours. it's got economic collapse, rampant
                capitalism left so completely unfettered that it's formed enormous conglomerates, everyone 
                drowning in debt and work. the show predicted the rise of cryptocurrency back in 2017. it's 
                a world where a lot of people die and no one's left to care about it.</p>
                <p>it's about being so particularly and paralyzingly alone that living in the world becomes
                so untenable that it has to change. then it asks the question: what happens after you change
                the world, and everything keeps turning anyway, way outside your control? 
                </p>
                <p>this naturally fits into: <b>crime</b>, <b>near-future sci-fi</b>, <b>urban fantasy</b>, 
                <b>certain kinds of horror</b>. anything else is workable. you'd be shocked how easy it is 
                to find an analogue for hacking in most settings.</p>
                <p>themes: neo-noir, technology, social isolation, revolution, anti-capitalism.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-break">Every day we change the world. But to change the world in a way that means 
            anything that take more time that most people have. It never happens all at once. It's slow. It's 
            methodical. It's exhausting. We don't all have the stomach for it.</div>

                <h2>WHAT WOULD MY CHARACTER KNOW?</h2>

                    <div>
                        <h3>THE PUBLIC KNOWS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>elliot alderson was associated with stopping the washington township nuclear plant from melting down over christmas 2015.</li>
                            <li>everyone else in the power plant died, including the leader of the infamous deus group, a collection of the hundred or so richest people in the world.</li>
                            <li>fsociety, a hacker collective, outed the deus group. they were also responsible for 5/9 in early 2015, which encrypted most debt records and tanked the economy. they later fixed that.</li>
                            <li>they're also associated with blowing up 71 buildings and killing thousands of people. there's a lot of talk about that one.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>HACKERS KNOW</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sepi0l is an infamous and nigh-invisible hacker who disappeared for most of 2015 and then resurfaced in late 2016.</li>
                            <li>no one really knows anything about the original members of fsociety. there was a secondary group that popped up after 5/9, but the footprint wasn't the same.</li>
                            <li>lots of rumors about fsociety in general. people say they were a part of it, but that might not be true. there's plenty of groups who popped up trying to be their successors, too.</li>
                            <li>in terms of work, sepi0l spends a lot of time on irc boards and has written some fucking unhinged malware. they love open source projects and they hate suits, whether government or business.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>elliot alderson has a criminal record. he took a deal to not be tried for property damage, and later went to jail for computer hacking and stealing a guy's dog.</li>
                            <li>elliot alderson was investigated by the fbi in connection to fsociety, 5/9, and the 71 buildings. he wasn't charged. a lot of it seems to rest at the feet of now-deceased e corp cto tyrell wellick.</li>
                            <li>if you're at a high enough clearance level, you know more about the details. elliot's sister was briefly arrested in connection to fsociety. it appears that a lot of what happened was related to the dark army, a criminal hacking syndicate used by the deus group as their muscle.</li>
