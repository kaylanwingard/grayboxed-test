                <h2>SO, WHAT'S THE WORLD LOOK LIKE?</h2>
                <p>imagine a world like ours, but a few seconds closer to midnight. the world of <i>mr. robot</i>
                is barely outside of the one we live in. it's a little grimier, a little angrier, and a lot
                more prone to revolution, but mostly, it's just like ours. it's got economic collapse, rampant
                capitalism left so completely unfettered that it's formed enormous conglomerates, everyone 
                drowning in debt and work. the show predicted the rise of cryptocurrency back in 2017. it's 
                a world where a lot of people die and no one's left to care about it.</p>
                <p>it's about being so particularly and paralyzingly alone that living in the world becomes
                so untenable that it has to change. then it asks the question: what happens after you change
                the world, and everything keeps turning anyway, way outside your control? 
                </p>
                <p>this naturally fits into: <b>crime</b>, <b>near-future sci-fi</b>, <b>urban fantasy</b>, 
                <b>certain kinds of horror</b>. anything else is workable. you'd be shocked how easy it is 
                to find an analogue for hacking in most settings.</p>
                <p>themes: neo-noir, technology, social isolation, revolution, anti-capitalism.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-break">Every day we change the world. But to change the world in a way that means 
            anything that take more time that most people have. It never happens all at once. It's slow. It's 
            methodical. It's exhausting. We don't all have the stomach for it.</div>
