                            <p>this arc extends from a few years after college, so when elliot is 24-25, all the way 
                                through until the start of canon, when he's 28. during this time, elliot alderson is 
                                just some guy living in new york city and working a series of soul-crushing information 
                                security jobs. he works in pentesting, helping to secure the very companies he generally 
                                hates against people like him.
                            </p>
                            <p>this all changes a little before canon. he's working at another company, grinding away, when 
                                memorial day weekend comes around. his boss says that everyone has to stay as long as the 
                                last person does. elliot is a workaholic who has practically no life outside of work, so he 
                                ends up working in the server room. they literally forget about him and he's locked in there, 
                                blacks out, smashes up the whole server room while blacked out, and wakes up in the aftermath. 
                                of course he's fired and loses his job. the only reason he doesn't go to jail is that he agrees 
                                to do court mandated therapy.
                            </p>
                            <p>from there, it's the daily grind, all the way until it isn't any more.</p>

                            <p>one day, a guy on the subway starts talking to him. never introduces himself, so elliot starts calling him mr. robot. this is how elliot ends up getting introduced to fsociety, a group of hackers trying to bring down e corp by hacking them, obtaining their debt records, and then encrypting them, effectively killing debt.</p>
                            <p>throughout this period of time, elliot gets clean, his girlfriend dies to a drug dealer, and he eventually realizes he has did. he has doubts about fsociety's plan, but he wants to bring e corp down. fsociety ends up working with the dark army, an international group of hackers (and more) to help deploy their code at e corp's data centers based in china. they're led by a mysterious figure named whiterose. this leads to the end of the season, where he blacks out, fsociety completes the hack, and elliot comes back to a world changed. the day the world economy collapsed is immortalized as 5/9.

                            <p>elliot spends most of this season in prison. he is sent to jail for stealing his dog, flipper, and for computer hacking. rather than fight the charges, he pleads guilty in order to go to prison and basically trap himself in there, building a loop he goes through day by day. he befriends a few inmates and goes through multiple levels of terrible things while in prison. he and mr. robot seem to come to some kind of agreement. eventually, elliot is eventually released early through whiterose's machinations.</p>
                            <p> during this time, fsociety has gone from a small focused hacker group to a larger collective doing more publicity stunts, such as vandalizing the wall street bull. the nature of the group is changing, led by elliot's sister, darlene, who is definitely not equipped to do this.</p>
                            <p>once elliot gets out of prison, he finds out that there's another stage to the plan after 5/9 he wasn't aware ofâ€”but mr. robot was. he ends up meeting up with tyrell wellick, a former e corp executive turned fugitive and scapegoat for 5/9, to discuss this mysterious next phase. tyrell ends up shooting elliot when he tries to intervene.</p>

                            <p>elliot is stitched up by the dark army. he ends up getting a job at e corp to try to monitor and fix what he's done, and to stop the dark army. because he's very definitely very educated on mental illness, he thinks that mr. robot is gone. of course, he isn't. behind the scenes mr. robot is working with tyrell and the dark army to enact stage two, which involves blowing up a recovery center in nyc to destroy all the paper debt records, permanently erasing it.</p>
                            <p>about that whole plan. elliot has been spending his days at e corp quietly shipping paper records to a bunch of other locations rather than one centralized location. he works away at this, as in the background, whiterose feuds with the e corp ceo, a man named philip price. and on the day when it's all supposed to happen, everything falls apart. elliot finds out his friend angela, who got him the e corp job, was working for the dark army to monitor him. and then the dark army blows up 71 buildings worldwide, using the code invented for what was supposed to be one explosion. it was going to be 72, if not for elliot's personal intervention at the nyc recovery building.</p>
                            <p>as you can imagine, things get worse from there. everything collapses. angela crumbles. elliot falls apart, all the way up until a twist of fate forces him to get back up again. he makes a personal vow to go after whiterose and the dark army.
            
                            and then whiterose kills angela, because her usefulness is done. then it's beyond a vendetta. then it turns into revenge. </p>

                            <p>and he does, eventually, but only after horrific revelations about himself, his past, and the kind of person he can be when the chips are down.</p>
                            <p>he manages to steal all of whiterose's money from a select group of the richest people alive, known as the deus group. she's been using this money to fund a project based in washington township, elliot's hometownâ€”an attempt to jump to a better universe, one where everything goes right. elliot steals all that money, redistributes it, and then goes to washington township to try and sabotage the machine.</p>

                                <p>rather than staying in nyc, elliot goes on the road with leon, the hitman he befriended during his stay in jail. the two of them travel around, sometimes with darlene, sometimes not, and take up odd jobs. having a hacker and a hitman together opens a lot of doors for both of them. elliot's still not interested in killing. it's just what he wants to do, but he doesn't really mind doing crime. and he loves hacking companies.</p>
                                <p>this version of the story is about learning independence. about going out into the world and engaging with it as best you can, including a world unfamiliar to you. it's about learning what you can and can't do, what your limits are, and understanding yourself so that one day you can go home and stay in place without losing yourself. this is the most dynamic post-canon verse.</p>

                                <p>this version is about putting down roots. it's about dealing with the repercussions of what happened when they're all around you, all the time, and figuring out the kind of person you can be afterwards. it's extremely rooted in place. it's also possible for the prior option to feed into this one over time, where elliot settles after a period of traveling and self-discovery.</p>

              <p> all you have to do to toss him into night city is to call him a netrunner instead of a hacker, and have him associated with stopping a power plant meltdown a little while back. </p>
              <p>he's got all the same mental illnesses, all the same hangups, the same scraping for money as everyone else, and plenty of bitterness at the fucked up nightmare system that runs the world. he hates every single corporation so badly that it basically singlehandedly keeps him alive when the money isn't quite making ends meet. </p>

                            <p>this whole thing basically exists to allow elliot to interact with more modern supernatural characters in context. he's most of the same thingsâ€”a paranoid hacker, a very mentally ill guy, and a loner, but the main difference is that he also has some spellcasting ability. much like hacking, this is something he's good at, and he mainly uses it to warp reality in small ways. he also uses it to ward all of his stuff, befitting the paranoia. basically, imagine a hacker's mindset extended into magic. i like to imagine magic that is very visceral, very body horror-adjacent, sort of like the dead takes the a train, where you keep spells tucked away under your skin to prepare them and it hurts to use them. so a little bloody, a lot of giving up bits of yourself, and scary once it really gets going. </p>

                            <p>first things first, here's what you came here for: human rogue 2 / order of scribes wizard 6. thank you for your time. </p>
            <p>in all seriousness. i still haven't played bg3 (i know, i know) but i do know a hell of a lot about dnd lore in general, so i can make it work.</p>
            <p>in short, elliot in this is a weird little guy who can pick locks like a professional and is a walking spell repository (order of scribes, i'm telling you). depending on when you meet him he is either in the throes of wanting to rob various members of the aristocracy and other bastards, complicit in blowing up seventy-one buildings through some truly horrific spellwork, in the midst of a huge nightmarish revenge scheme against a master of chronurgy, or a few years out from that whole mess and trying to be more of a person. sort of depends on what flavor of terrible time you want going on. </p>
            <p>he's quiet. he's lost a lot of people. he doesn't talk a lot about himself, and he's more likely to talk about his own mental illness (which he will describe not using modern terms, for obvious reasons) before talking about the whole 'blowing up 71 buildings' thing. </p>
