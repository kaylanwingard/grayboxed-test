                <h2>PHYSICALITY</h2>
                <span>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES</span> multiple people have commented on
                his “bug eyes”, which is probably fair enough. he tries to make
                himself invisible and innocuous as much as possible. often seen in a
                black hoodie, but not always.<br />
                <span>HEIGHT</span> 5'7”<br />
                <span>PHYSICAL AILMENTS</span> chronic back pain, temporomandibular
                joint dysfunction<br />
                <span>PIERCINGS/TATTOOS</span> none<br />
                <span>SCARS</span> many. notable ones include old cigarette burns on
                his arms, a few long thin ones that are both older, and the scar from
                a gunshot set right in the middle of his stomach.<br />
                <span>SPEECH/TONE</span> generally soft-spoken and slower, but can
                speed up and become more fluid depending on who's fronting and how
                upset he is.<br />
                <span>BODY TYPE</span> scrawny and small. he doesn’t look healthy and
                he never has. he can run more than you expect, though.<br />
                <span>HAIR</span> black, shaved on the sides, gets curly if he lets it
                grow out, which he practically never does unless in a particularly bad
                brain state.<br />
                <span>WARDROBE</span> minimalist, mostly neutrals. often seen in a
                black hoodie. may wear other jackets, but generally doesn't go for
                anything more adventurous than a dark blue. incredibly bad at getting
                clothes that fit him properly—things tend to be a little too large, as
                if trying to hide himself.

                <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
                <span>STAR SIGN</span> virgo<br />
                <span>ALIGNMENT</span> floating somewhere between neutral good to
                chaotic neutral, somewhere in that corner<br />
                <span>MBTI</span> infp (the mediator)/intp (the logician)<br />
                <span>FIVE POSITIVES</span> intelligent, creative, ethical (in his own
                way), focused, perceptive<br />
                <span>FIVE NEGATIVES</span> anxious, impulsive, isolated, paranoid,
                very, very angry<br />
                <span>RELIGION</span> raised in an evangelical household. very much not
                okay with religion now.<br />
                <span>ILLNESSES</span> dissociative identity disorder, c-ptsd,
                depression, anxiety<br />
                <span>KNOWN LANGUAGES</span> english, some conversational arabic<br />
                <span>SKILLS</span> hacking, social engineering, lockpicking. basically
                anything in the hacker's toolkit. a genuinely impressive ability to
                think up plans of attack. very good at making himself nigh-invisible. <br />
                <span>INTERESTS</span> very singularly fixated on hacking. also likes to
                draw, eventually gets into miniature painting and kitbashing, would
                eventually like a motorcycle if people can convince him to ride one<br />
                <span>INTELLIGENCE</span> absurdly smart in many ways. emotionally
                oblivious, but mostly in ways that are stunted by severe trauma. may or
                may not be good at reading people depending on who you're talking about
                (the more confident they are about reading people, the less right they
                probably are).<br />
