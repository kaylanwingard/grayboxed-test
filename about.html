                <h2>PHYSICALITY</h2>
                <span>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES</span> multiple people have commented on
                his “bug eyes”, which is probably fair enough. he tries to make
                himself invisible and innocuous as much as possible. often seen in a
                black hoodie, but not always.<br />
                <span>HEIGHT</span> 5'7”<br />
                <span>PHYSICAL AILMENTS</span> chronic back pain, temporomandibular
                joint dysfunction<br />
                <span>PIERCINGS/TATTOOS</span> none<br />
                <span>SCARS</span> many. notable ones include old cigarette burns on
                his arms, a few long thin ones that are both older, and the scar from
                a gunshot set right in the middle of his stomach.<br />
                <span>SPEECH/TONE</span> generally soft-spoken and slower, but can
                speed up and become more fluid depending on who's fronting and how
                upset he is.<br />
                <span>BODY TYPE</span> scrawny and small. he doesn’t look healthy and
                he never has. he can run more than you expect, though.<br />
                <span>HAIR</span> black, shaved on the sides, gets curly if he lets it
                grow out, which he practically never does unless in a particularly bad
                brain state.<br />
                <span>WARDROBE</span> minimalist, mostly neutrals. often seen in a
                black hoodie. may wear other jackets, but generally doesn't go for
                anything more adventurous than a dark blue. incredibly bad at getting
                clothes that fit him properly—things tend to be a little too large, as
                if trying to hide himself.

                <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
                <span>STAR SIGN</span> virgo<br />
                <span>ALIGNMENT</span> floating somewhere between neutral good to
                chaotic neutral, somewhere in that corner<br />
                <span>MBTI</span> infp (the mediator)/intp (the logician)<br />
                <span>FIVE POSITIVES</span> intelligent, creative, ethical (in his own
                way), focused, perceptive<br />
                <span>FIVE NEGATIVES</span> anxious, impulsive, isolated, paranoid,
                very, very angry<br />
                <span>RELIGION</span> raised in an evangelical household. very much not
                okay with religion now.<br />
                <span>ILLNESSES</span> dissociative identity disorder, c-ptsd,
                depression, anxiety<br />
                <span>KNOWN LANGUAGES</span> english, some conversational arabic<br />
                <span>SKILLS</span> hacking, social engineering, lockpicking. basically
                anything in the hacker's toolkit. a genuinely impressive ability to
                think up plans of attack. very good at making himself nigh-invisible. <br />
                <span>INTERESTS</span> very singularly fixated on hacking. also likes to
                draw, eventually gets into miniature painting and kitbashing, would
                eventually like a motorcycle if people can convince him to ride one<br />
                <span>INTELLIGENCE</span> absurdly smart in many ways. emotionally
                oblivious, but mostly in ways that are stunted by severe trauma. may or
                may not be good at reading people depending on who you're talking about
                (the more confident they are about reading people, the less right they
                probably are).<br />

                <div class="name">HOST</div>
                <span>IN CONTROL (POST-S4)</span>
    
                disappeared for the events of 2015. felt helpless in an uncaring
                world after years of trauma; crushed by the forces of capitalism.
                probably kinder than you'd expect; still dislikes people and
                crowds, but less outright paranoid. in control post-series. coming
                to terms with everything that happened.

            <div class="mm alter">
                <div class="name">MASTERMIND</div>
                <span>IN CONTROL (S1-S4)</span>
    
                the instigator and main character of mr. robot, and the alter you're most likely to meet if your character met elliot over the events of the series. the mastermind was made to hold elliot's rage and to be an active force in an unbearable world. in control from october 2014 to the end of 2015. brilliant. troubled. relentless.

            <div class="pro alter">
                <div class="name">PROTECTOR</div>
                <span>INTERMITTENT</span>
    
                the first alter to exist. mostly bark and less bite than the mastermind, but dangerous in his own right. will protect the system. will hurt other people to protect the system. has the most self-preservation and a paternal instinct towards the other alters and the people they care about. honestly kind of an asshole. 
            </div>

                <div class="name">PERSECUTOR</div>
                <span>UNAVAILABLE</span>
    
                modeled after elliot's mother. holds most of the negative and abusive messages that were imparted to him throughout his childhood. her function is to, in short, teach them how to "behave" in order to avoid upsetting the abuser (i.e. elliot's mother, in this case) in the future. will not be written on this blog. 
            </div>
            <div class="little alter">
                <div class="name">LITTLE</div>
                <span>UNAVAILABLE</span>
    
                created to partition off much of the abuse elliot suffered. protected very deeply by the rest of the system and very rarely if ever fronts. will not be written on this blog. please don't ask.
